# Sorted Addon for World of Warcraft
## Original Content

- Original URL: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/sorted
- Original Author: Daft_Vader_

## Notes
This repo was created to update the addon as Daft_Vader_ is no longer playing wow and the original addon on curse is no longer maintaned.
I've reached out to Daft_Vader_ to see if he's ok with me updating this addon and maintaning it for the time being.

I have very little wow addon experience and will only be maintaning the retail version of the addon at the momment.

Thanks!

## 9.1.5 Fixes/Issues
